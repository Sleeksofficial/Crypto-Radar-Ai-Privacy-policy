# Privacy Policy — CryptoRadar AI Bot

_Last updated: August 31, 2025_

This Privacy Policy describes how **CryptoRadar AI Bot** (“the Bot”) handles data on Telegram.

> **Summary:** We only process the commands you send to the Bot and the chat/user IDs required to reply. We do not sell or profile users. Logs, when enabled for debugging, are temporary.

---

## 1) Information We Collect
- **Command content** you send to the Bot (e.g., `/topcoins`, `/airdrops`, `/aipredict`, `/memecoins`).
- **Technical identifiers** required to deliver messages: Telegram **chat ID** and **user ID**.
- **No sensitive personal data** (e.g., name, phone, email) is requested or required.

## 2) How We Use Information
- To process commands and send back crypto information, watchlists, and AI predictions.
- To keep the Bot reliable and secure (rate limiting, abuse prevention, and debugging).

## 3) Data Sharing
- We **do not sell or share** your Telegram information with third parties.
- The Bot queries external APIs to retrieve market data and generate AI responses. Only **command text** (not your Telegram ID) may be sent to:
  - **CoinGecko**, **CoinPaprika** (market data)
  - **OpenAI** (text generation/analysis)

## 4) Data Retention
- The Bot does **not** permanently store your messages or chat IDs.
- Diagnostic logs, when enabled, are short‑lived and periodically deleted.

## 5) Your Choices & Control
- You can stop using the Bot at any time by removing it from your chats.
- To request deletion of specific debug logs (if any exist), contact the publisher below with your **user ID** and **chat ID**.

## 6) Security
- We use access tokens and least‑privilege credentials for connected services.
- Where possible, we minimize data sent to third‑party APIs and avoid storing raw message content.

## 7) Children’s Privacy
- The Bot is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect information from children under applicable age thresholds.

## 8) Changes to This Policy
- Material changes will be reflected in this README with an updated date.
